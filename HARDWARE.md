Here you will find a list of common hardware elements I use in almost all my builds and why.

## Screws

- **DIN 912/ISO 4672 Hex socket machine head screws**; Most of the time they're going to be M3x30 screws used for the Neutrik port (if there is one)  
- **DIN 7991/ISO 10642 Hex socket countersunk screws**; Usually M3x8, for things that need to be screwed down without any protrusion (mostly top and bottom panels)
- **ISO 7380 (no known DIN equivalent) Hex socket button head screws**; Also usually M3x8, I tend to use them for top panels/acrylic

If you're not a fan of hex screws, I found these Torx equivalents that are drop-in replacements (so long as you keep the same lengths)

- **DIN 912 TX/ISO 14579 Torx machine head screw**
- **DIN 7991 TX/ISO 14581 Torx countersunk screws**
- **ISO 7380-2 Torx button head screws**

## Mounting hardware

- **Ruthex M3S heat-set inserts**; You're probably familiar with those (and if you're not, you're going to be soon). Insert them into plastic using a soldering iron to get threads that are way better than modeled or tapped threads (into plastic anyway)
- **Steel or brass rods**; Butt-joining printed parts is a good step, but sometimes you need to take extra precautions to prevent the joined parts from bending. I usually stick to 200x3mm for practicality. I only tested those materials, I know RC enthuisiasts now deal with carbon fiber rods but I don't see the point for those builds.

## Aesthetic stuff

- **3mm thick acrylic sheets**; Well... If you don't know what this is I don't think I can help you. 3mm is a common size and helps with top panel stability. It doesn't actually *need* to be 3mm, it's just super convenient and easy to laser
- **Polymaker (Panchroma) Galaxy Black filament**; My go-to GOAT filament. Masks even super thicc layer lines (I usually print at .25mm). There are other brands and not just in PLA either (Prusa is known for their own Galaxy Black PLA blend, but they also have Galaxy Black PETG, and Polymaker does ASA too). I stick to PLA for the most part
- **Polymaker PolyTerra Charcoal Black PLA**; My other staple filament. Also really good at masking layer lines and giving the end product a more polished appearance. Like all matte PLA layer adhesion is a hair weaker than regular glossy PLA (not fully sure why), but since I usually print perpendicular to expected force vectors this is a non-issue
