This is a variation of the Wanderer intended to be able to play both traditional fighters as well as party games. The chassis has been lengthened to 400mm to give room for all the buttons.

The OLED display isn't *really* required, but it's not really optional either; considering the major layout diffs between trad fighters and platform fighters, it definitely will help to know which config one's running.

Expect cable management duties to be hard and heavy, as the otherwise resulting rat's nest is quite substantial.

## Parts list

Must be exactly matched:

- 20x M3S Ruthex heat-set inserts (4 for the board, 16 for the plates)
- 1x Neutrik NA-USB
- One GP2040-CE compatible OLED display (SSH1106 or SSD1306)

Exact match not needed except for dimensions:

- 4x ISO 7380 M3x8 hex socket button head screws
- 8x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M3x8 hex socket countersunk screws
- 2x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x35 hex socket head cap screws for the Neutrik
- 2x DIN 934/ISO 4032 M3 hex nuts
- 2x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3 hex socket head cap screws to mount the board (adapt the length to your standoffs, you need at least 4mm)

It's Whatever (tm):

- 3mm thick material for the sides (acrylic, 3D printed plastic, wood, metal, cardboard, marble, dry ice...)
- 4mm thick material for the top and bottom plates

Tools && auxiliaries:

- Soldering iron
- (Optional but recommended) Medium strength threadlocker, aka blue Loctite(tm)
- M3 standoffs if you wish to route wires under the board/do some actual cable management
- Cable sleeves && heat shrink tubing

## Build guide

The build process is almost identical to the regular Wanderer. Should you go for laser cut plates, adding the branding stuff might prove challenging to say the least, but functionality will remain unchanged.

## TODO

- GP2040-CE configuration
