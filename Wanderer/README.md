## Very simple build

---

This case is intended for a (relatively) compact build with all the features you'd normally expect in a modern fightstick, except art support. It can have a magnetic bottom plate though !

## The Stats

**Printability**: 5/5 (nothing to talk about)  
**Buildability**: 5/5 (your little sister can probably do it)  
**Extra hardware**: 5/5 (nothing unusual either)
**Price**: 5/5 (as cheap as a full size case can get)

Really the only problem is that the case is a little plain looking. YMMV.

## Parts list

Must be exactly matched:

- 16x M3S Ruthex heat-set inserts
- 1x Neutrik NA-USB

Exact match not needed except for dimensions:

- 16x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M3x8 hex socket countersunk screws
- 2x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x35 hex socket head cap screws for the Neutrik
- 2x DIN 934/ISO 4032 M3 hex nuts

It's Whatever (tm):

- 3mm thick material for the sides (acrylic, 3D printed plastic, wood, metal, cardboard, marble, dry ice...)

Tools && auxiliaries:

- Soldering iron
- (Optional but recommended) Medium strength threadlocker, aka blue Loctite(tm)

## Build guide

Print the two center joints (`centerfront` and `centerbottom`) upside down to minimize support usage.

Print the four corner posts (`post`) and add the magnets at the bottom, checking that they have the same polarity.

Print the bottom pieces, add the magnets while being careful that the polarity matches with those on the posts (in case this needs to be said outright, the posts should all attract the bottom plates).

At this point you have two (not mutually exclusive) choices:

### The Laser Way

Congratulations, you found a couple of nice sheets of 3mm thick material !  
Bring the laser cut files to your favorite shop and laser away. It's kind of that simple.

### The Printer Way

Actually it's mostly the same thing, except you just upload the STL files to your printer and wait the requisite amount of hours. (Specifically: one `left`, one `right`, and four `bridge` for the sides; and both halves of whichever top you pick)

### Moving on

Assemble the frame pieces together, without the corner posts. Slot in your top panels, and then screw the posts in. Optionally, weld the top panel halves together from the inside.

Add your electronics (I know, this is a vague step, but that's as general as I need it to be)

Screw in your bottom panel (you can also weld it from the inside).

Boom, fightstick !
