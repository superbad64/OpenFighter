---

An all-around, semi-compact case that has the footprint of an A4 sheet. Supports art prints.

## The Stats

**Printability**: 5/5 (no gimmicks)  
**Buildability**: 4/5 (press-fit is a little hard but nothing insurmountable)  
**Extra hardware**: 5/5 (nothing outside of acrylic and heat set inserts)  
**Price**: 4.5/5 (it does need a lot of filament but nowhere near the Ogre, so it's still fairly cheap)

## Parts list

Must be exactly matched:

- 20x M3S Ruthex heat-set inserts:
    - 8 for the bottom panels
    - 8 for the top panels
    - 4 for the acrylic
- 1x A4-sized 3mm thick sheet of material to laser cut for the top panel (acrylic, wood, brass...)

Exact match not needed except for dimensions:

- 4x ISO 7380 M3x5 hex socket button head screws for the acrylic
- 24x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M3x8 hex socket countersunk screws:
    - 8 for the bottom panel
    - 8 for the top panel
    - 4 for the acrylic
    - 4 to mount the lever (if applicable)
- 4x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M4x10 hex socket countersunk screws to mount the lever
- 2x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x30 hex socket head cap screws for the Neutrik
- 4x M3 washer (also for the lever if there is one)
- 6x DIN 934/ISO 4032 M3 hex nuts

Tools && auxiliaries:

- Soldering iron
- (Optional but recommended) Neoprene glue/contact cement. CA glue should work too
- (Optional but recommended) Medium strength threadlocker, aka blue Loctite(tm)

## Build guide

Print four corner pieces, the left and right ones, front and back dividers, the four short sides, then the bottom file twice. Press fit all parts of the frame together (clamps might help). Add heat set inserts.

Pick a layout and print the top plates. Screw them to the frame. Get your art printed, your acrylic cut, and add them to the top. Secure with screws.

Time to build the electronics !

## TODO

- Sega 2P layout
- Better render
- All art & cut files
