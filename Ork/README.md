## Regular fightstick case

![Waaaaagh !](../img/ork.png)

---

This case is intended for a (relatively) compact build with all the features you'd normally expect in a modern fightstick.

## Parts list

Must be exactly matched:

- 16x M3S Ruthex heat-set inserts:
    - 8 for the bottom panels
    - 4 to attach the center joint pieces to the left && right frame parts
    - 4 for the top panel
- 1x A4-sized 3mm thick sheet of material to laser cut for the top panel (acrylic, wood, brass...)

Exact match not needed except for dimensions:

- 4x ISO 7380 M3x8 hex socket button head screws for the acrylic
- 12x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M3x8 hex socket countersunk screws:
    - 8 for the bottom panel
    - 4 to attach the frame to the center joint pieces
- 2x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x30 hex socket head cap screws for the Neutrik
- 2x DIN 934/ISO 4032 M3 hex nuts

Tools && auxiliaries:

- Soldering iron
- (Optional but recommended) Neoprene glue/contact cement. CA glue should work too
- (Optional but recommended) Medium strength threadlocker, aka blue Loctite(tm)

## Build guide

Print the left && right frame parts corresponding to your layout of choice, the two center joints, and four biscuits. Join them, using glue and/or welding on the inside if needed. Add heat-set inserts. Use 2 DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M3x8 hex socket countersunk screws to secure the top panel to the center joints.

Mount the Neutrik to the center front joiner using the two DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x30 cap screws and the DIN 934/ISO 4032 hex nuts. Add your internals too (buttons, board, wires...)

Print the bottom panel pieces, weld them if needed, and attach them to the frame.

Get your topmost panel cut (and art if you want to) and secure it to the frame.
