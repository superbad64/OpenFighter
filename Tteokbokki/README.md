# T.T.E.O.K.B.O.K.K.I. Top Grade Case
## Also known as "We have [REDACTED] at home"

> [!NOTE]
> This case is currently being worked on (like doing tests about using wood dowels instead of steel rods and such). Be advised that not everything is super fine tuned yet.

A case that I swear no one has ever seen around. Comes with a magnetically attached bottom plate.

## The Stats

**Printability**: 4/5 (you do need a setup that is particularly good at bevels)  
**Buildability**: 3/5 (mine had an issue with one rod out of four, so you might want to keep some WD40 on hand)  
**Extra hardware**: 3/5 (does need a fair amount of screws, and the rods can be hard to source)  
**Price**: 3/5 (the hardware *really* drives the BOM up on this one)  

## Some context and questions I've been asked about it

A few months ago I made the [Raijin](https://github.com/superbad64/OpenFighter/tree/main/Personal%20Builds/Raijin) out of a desire to have a full-collar Korean build. Due to the frankly ludicrous BOM on it, I decided to revisit it, and the end result happened to be this very build.

For printability's sake I made one with full sides, instead of the recessed ones pictured above. The files for it are also available in the STL folder. Main difference is print orientation; support use is about the same either way, you just need to be *veeeeery* confident in your printer's ability to do that kind of bevel without support.

Do keep in mind that this was *supposed* to be filled, sanded, primed, and then painted to hide the joint seams; therefore some of the conception really does not account for a default "extruded plastic" look. (It works though, but that's more a happy accident than anything else)

### What are those plates on the front ?

Basically I took a page out of the AFS enclosures who often have a ton of button holes on the front panel (6 + 3 Neutrik-style outlets), except I also have a need for things that are neither round nor fittable in a 24mm round hole (like, say, a Nunchuk port, or a tournament lockout switch). So I decided to make the holes slightly larger and use cover plates that I can then adapt for whatever hare-brained purpose I can find today. As an added bonus you can use them for accent colors !

## Parts list

Must be exactly matched:

- 14x M3S Ruthex heat-set inserts:
    - 6 for the acrylic
    - 8 for the top panels
- 1x A3-sized 3mm thick sheet of material to drill or laser cut for the top panel (acrylic, wood, brass...)

Exact match not needed except for dimensions:

- 8x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M3x8 hex socket countersunk screws for the top panel halves
- 6x ISO 7380 M3x8 hex socket button head screws for the acrylic
- 4x DIN 7991/ISO 10642 M4x16 hex socket countersunk screws to mount the lever (if you choose to have one of course)
    - In a pinch, M3x16 also works as long as you're using a washer
- 2x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x30 hex socket head cap screws for the Neutrik
- 12x DIN 912/ISO 4672 M3x20 hex socket head cap screws for the front plates
- 16x M3 nuts and washers
- 8 or 12x 15 by 3 millimeters disc-shaped magnets (I find 8 to be largely enough but you do you)
- 4x 3 by 300 millimeters steel rods (**This one is subject to change**)

Tools && auxiliaries:

- Soldering iron
- Multi-purpose pliers to tighten all those nuts
- Neoprene glue/contact cement
- (Optional but **vigorously** recommended) *Long* ratcheting clamps
- (Optional but recommended) Medium strength threadlocker, aka blue Loctite(tm)

## Build guide

Print both frame halves and carefully remove the supports. Insert the rods in the guiding holes and join the halves together, using neoprene glue.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While I'm unsure of the exact effects of neoprene glue fumes on the human body/nervous system, it seems like a good idea to avoid spreading said glue too close to the holes into which a heat-set insert is going to be added in a few moments.

If you have some, use the ratcheting clamps to make sure everything is super tight (you shouldn't *need* to but it can't hurt). Let the glue cure for a day.

Add the heat-set inserts to the holes on the top side. Screw in the top panels of your choice using the inner holes (relative to each panel); the outer holes are for the acrylic.

Use some more neoprene glue to attach half of the the magnets to the frame. Whilst being mindful of the polarity, attach the other half to the bottom panels.

Join the three bottom panel parts together using... you guessed it, neoprene glue. After curing, you can plastic weld the non-glued parts to further improve stability.
