Sloped build to reduce wrist pain. Originally envisioned as a pure acrylic cut build, turns out it's also printable (who knew lmao). More info to come SOON(tm)

## The Stats

**Printability**: ?/5 (I haven't actually built one, but all the pieces are extremely simple geometry, so it should be a 5)  
**Buildability**: ?/5 (ditto)  
**Extra hardware**: Probably 1/5 if you run it in full laser cut acrylic as intended, and 5/5 if you print it (again, still haven't built one)
**Price**: Probably -2/5 for the acrylic, and 5/5 for the printed one
